# autotest

This is vmuxIO's subproject for automated testing (autotest).

## How To Use It

Before you use this, make sure you have:
- SSH keys and config in place for password-less connection to the
  host, guest and loadgen machines set in `autotest.cfg` ... default:
  river, wilfred and the guest VM.
- A clone of the `vmuxIO/dat` repo (https://github.com/vmuxIO/dat) in the
  location set in `tests.cfg` ... default: `../../dat` from this folder.
- All the necessary stuff like scripts, image files, and configuration done
  for your user on river and wilfred ... I will include those scripts asap.
